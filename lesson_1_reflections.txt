How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It highlighted the changes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Keep track of all versions and allow you to revert to prior changes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: you commit at logical changes, automatic saving can't do that; 
    Con: system changes can be safe when you have power outtage or forget to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    In programming files are logically interrelated; google docs isn't designed
    like that, it's geared toward files that are independent of each other

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log show the description of your commit, you can use that to identify the 
    commit id of it and then use git diff to compare that id with the previous one
    to see the changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It's very easy to revert back to the prior version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To keep track of all my project code :)
